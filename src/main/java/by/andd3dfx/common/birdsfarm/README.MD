# Birds farm

Add the missing code to Chicken and Egg so the following actions are completed:

- Chicken implements the IBird base class.
- A Chicken lays an egg that will hatch into a new Chicken.
- Eggs from other types of birds should hatch into a new bird of their parent type.
- Hatching an egg for the second time throws an IllegalStateException.

```java
interface IBird {
    Egg lay();
}

class Chicken {
    public Chicken() {
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        Chicken chicken = new Chicken();
        System.out.println(chicken instanceof IBird);
    }
}

class Egg {
    public Egg(Callable<IBird> createBird) {
        throw new UnsupportedOperationException("Waiting to be implemented.");
    }

    public IBird hatch() throws Exception {
        throw new UnsupportedOperationException("Waiting to be implemented.");
    }
}
```

Tests:

- Chicken is an IBird
- Chickens make other chickens
- Other birds don't make chickens
- Eggs can't hatch twice
